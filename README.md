# PongGame
Simple one player pong game. First game I've ever made so I'm still proud of it.

# Instructions
To move the paddle, use the UP and DOWN arrow keys or use W and S.

Try to stop the ball from reaching your side of the screen.

If you miss the ball then you will lose five points.

If you hit the ball then you will gain one point.

# Installation

To download and play the game, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/jhok2013/PongGame.git`.

Alternatively, just navigate to the output directory and download the executable. From there, just click
on the .exe file to play the game.

To play from python on windows, type the following into the console:
`python __main__.py`
